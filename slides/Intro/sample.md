# Linear Algebra

Set of mathematical tools operating in the continuous domain (by
opposition to discrete mathematics) essential to understanding
machine learning tools. Â  

We will discuss among other things :

- scalar values, vector matrices, tensors

- basic operations between these quantities (addition, products)

- Vector spaces generated by a base, independence

- diagonalization, factorization
