# Recall

## Convolutional Neural Network

- Inspired by the visual cortex of the human brain
- Filter an image and capture the features and dependencies
- Pattern recognition

------

## Convolutional Neural Network - How it works :

### Kernel and Convolution operation

- Convolution operation on the image with a kernel.
-  Extraction of the image features

### Pooling Layer

- Reduction of the spatial size of the matrix resulted after a Convolution layer
- Help in extracting the dominant features
- Two types of Pooling

### Output Layer

- Softmax classification
